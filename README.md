**Project Title:** City Route Finder using Graphs

**Project Description:**
The City Route Finder project focuses on finding routes between specified nodes in a graph data structure representing a rectangular city area. Utilizing Python programs and graph data structures, the project aims to implement breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS) algorithms to find routes between nodes and cities within the city grid system. The project utilizes a 2D matrix list to store altitude data, enabling the determination of viable routes based on altitude constraints. Skills and tools covered include graph operations, 2D matrix manipulation, list operations, searching techniques, and data structures.

## Description
The project considers a rectangular city area, star_city, divided into a grid of square cells. Each border of star_city is adjacent to a different city: Greendale at the top, Smallville at the right, Duckburg at the bottom, and Blue Valley at the left. Each square cell represents the altitude of the land area, ranging from 1 (lowest) to 10 (highest). A person can move from a higher altitude area to a lower altitude area. Cells on the border are connected to the respective border city. The project seeks to find routes from a source cell to a destination cell, as well as routes from Blue Valley to Smallville.
